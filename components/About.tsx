                my name is bilal ashraf, and i've been working as a full-stack developer since 2017.
                technology is always changing, so i can't tell you for sure what technology is best to use
                at what time, but for the now, my efforts revolve around how to implement
                C#, Typescript, Tailwind CSS and Angular/React in a way that is scalable and efficient.
